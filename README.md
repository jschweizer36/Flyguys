  This submission is towards Lockheed Martin challenge: Reducing employee insider threat. We translated the information in the given database into threat levels per employee using python then presented the data using d3js. The presented pie chart shows the distribution of employees in different departments, upon hovering over a part of the pie chart the bar graph accompanying it shows the distribution of the employees in that department into threat levels where 0 means no threat and 6 means action is required immediately. The project will be available on a server reachable by following the above link.
